            <h3>Review the ongoing use of IT tools</h3>
            <br>
                <p>The tools I used to complete my project were Visual Studio Code and Trello. I was very happy 
                    using them as they assisted me in delivering a responsive website with content. VSCode creat, whereas Trello allowed me to stay on target.
                </p>
            <br>
            <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
            <br>
                <p>The tools selected were appropriate for the task at hand as the brief was to create a simple responsive website. If I were to expand on this brief, I would need to use a wider variety of processes.
                </p>
            <br>
            <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project â€“ </h3>
            <br>
                <p>I am happy with my project as this is my first attempt at coding and
                    i have managed to create a responsive website. There are a number of
                    things with given more time i would improve on  i.e. look of website, plus</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                I can make further improvements to my project by making it more user friendly. I would achieve this by changing the content 
                layout of my web pages and imagery. I would also like to input more functions  i.e. text to speech,  colour labels and transcript functions.
                I would also like to input more functions  i.e. text to speech,  colour labels, creating a navigation bar with a side overlay and add in more animation to make my project more impactful</p>
