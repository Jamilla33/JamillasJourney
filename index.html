           I am an upbeat lady who is a focused and dedicated team player. My expertise are in developing effective working relationships, customer service
           and problem solving aswell as making people look and feel great with my treatent portfolio.
           I am dynamic,
           versatile, curious and love to challenge myself hence why i joined this coding course. I wanted to learn how to create
           a website to market myself. I have always enjoyed IT and i am very creative. I felt that coding embodied both.
