            <h3>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3> 
            <p> A great benefit of using VsCode is that errors are easily identified and therefore easier to rectify. An added benefit, is by using similar coding throughout i.e. fonts, it is easy to copy and paste a lot of information. The drawbacks are that it is very sensitive. I would have benefited from being part of a team in order to brainstorm ideas and seek advice on HTML and CSS. </p>
            <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
            <p>Having a clear idea of layout of a website is important as it reduces the amount of time spent . Use of the Kanban method helps with targets. Having the ability to multitask and prioritise will improve productivity . Attention to detail will reduce time spent redoing projects.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>  
            <p>Ways that i would improve my productivity and efficiency is by streamlining processes and setting realistic time frames on project sections. I would also make better use of Trello and Slack for project planning and collaboration. I would also continue researching  coding language and implementation of functions.
                I could have been much more efficient when completing my project by having a better idea from the start of how I wanted the layout and imagery of my website, this would have cut down on many hours of research for things I did not implement in the end.
                </p>  
            <h3>3.4  Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
            <p>Whilst developing the website I underwent different stages of testing, continuously testing the functionality to ensure that codes implemented translated into a responsive website.
