            <h3>1.1 -  Describe the purpose of IT in modern business </h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of IT in modern business is to improve business processes and planning.
                For example, a fashion brand needs an efficient platform to market itself and increase sales. 
                Good resource management helps with product distribution and customer support, which results in
                increased value, enhanced quality and boosts productivity. Other benefits include, higher global sales,
                systematic management and real time monitoring. Innovation results in smarter apps, improved data storage, 
                faster processing and wider information distribution.

            <h3>1.2  Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
            <p>
                The success of a digital project depends on a variety of methods, skills and resources being utilised.
                Having good knowledge of HTML and CSS is imperative, in addition to flexibility and adaptability needed to complete
                a project. A fast and reliable internet connection is advantageous, as well as having the workspace to deliver on outcomes.
                A lot of copywriting and editing goes into completing a digital project, therefore attention to detail and good presentation skills are a must.
                Importantly, familiarising yourself with coding language is necessary.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website.</h3>
            <p> 
                A project plan is a must when creating a website. I developed a step by step guide in Trello 
                on what I would need to produce a website and how I would do so. I then broke it down into four parts:
                    - Research
                    - Design
                    - Compiling relevant information into HTML & CSS 
                    - Evaluation
            </p>
            <br>    
            <h3>1.4 - Risks that make digital projects fail</h3>
            <p>
                There are numerous risks that can make digital projects fail from the
                most obvious to the least. There could be problems with your software, alternatively
                internet connection failing before work can be saved, resulting in hours of lost research and data.
            </p>
            <h3>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
            <p>
                As I am always on the go and doing a variety of things, portable software helps me complete my work efficiently and easily.
                Therefore, I would choose the right technology based on my project brief and needs.
            </p>
            <h3>1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                In order to achieve the outcomes required, I used Trello which was helpful in reminding me of tasks that I 
                needed to complete. I then used this as a reference tool to make sure that I was completing my objectives 
                within the time frame. It is also a great ideas board.  Git and Github will help me to manage and keep track of my source code history,
                and i will also be able to collaborate with others.
                I have included a link to my Trello:
                <a href="https://trello.com/b/01pI9Cr3/jamillas-journey">Trello</a>
            </p>
            <h3>1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
            <p>
                One of the main constraints impacting digital projects is
                GDPR impacts digital projects as there are strict guidelines that must be followed, breaching these would result in a large fine and other penalties. Digital projects will now need to justify legally why the personal data they have collected is being processed, therefore limiting the scope of how much data is collected.
