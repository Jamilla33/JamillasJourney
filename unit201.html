                <h3>1.1</h3>
            <p>
                Firstly, I wanted a dark impactful website, my landing page would have a seperate image then a clickable 
                "enter" button and at the bottom of the page is my "about me" information.  The click button will then take the 
                user to the first unit page. The following pages have the navigation bar at the top linking content pages. 
                The final page is a contact page, which also has my employment history. I have reduced the image opacity to make it easier for users to view</p>
            <br>
            <p>    
                For the structure of the website i used and border styles to center paragraphs. For my navigation bar, I implemented a hover button to 
                highlight the sections, and also the clickable button to navigate from the landing page.
            </p>   
            <br>
            <p>
                To keep consistency within my website, I used a font family from google fonts called Quicksand, I did this by importing the URL into 
                my HTML page. I then adjusted the text area and headings to create easy to read text information.</p>

                <h3>1.5</h3>
            <p>
                Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites as they restrict what data developers are 
                able to publish. In order to comply, permission is 
                required from the original author which may prove tricky.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
                <h3>1.6</h3>
            <p>
                There are many issues that people with disabilities face when using web pages, such as not being able to recognise information required if they have visual impairments,
                unable to hear media content if they have hearing problems. This can be overcome by implementing features such as text to speech software, use of captions and transcripts, 
                contrast adjusting settings and many other functions.

                <h3>1.7</h3>
            <p>    
                There are many different filetypes for websites but the most commonly used are either JPEG or PNG. JPEG is mostly used for web pages as it compresses images.</p>
